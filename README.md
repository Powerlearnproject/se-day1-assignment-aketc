#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process designing, developing, testing and maintaining a software 
Its importance is to mainly ensure efficiency and reliability when completing or working on a repetitive task, speaking on efficiency it helps to reduce the cost of offereing services to clients in business and also fuels collaboration. In the technology Industry software engineering has created lots of job opportunities and career paths which has improved the livelihoods of people.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Era I: Mastering the Machine (1956–1967) - Code development was strongly influenced by outside forces. The main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize exploitation of the limited hardware resources. 

Era II: Mastering the Process (1968–1982) -  The aim was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. Software development methodologies appeared to define and monitor software building. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modeling approach that enables implementation automation. But for industry, this formal approach was unfeasible due to a lack of tools and training.

 Era III: Mastering the Complexity (1983–1992) - The up to then dominion of hardware over software ended. Personal computers arrived and opened the fields of computer applications. The software development process would now comprehensively address analysis and design from the specification. Graphical user interface and visual programming brought software closer to customers. The use of structured family and data modeling methodologies was extended



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
Developers perform requirement analysis by invoving customer inputs, and sales department or market surveys.  The information from this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. The quality of the project is a result of planning. In this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information.

Stage 2: Defining Requirements
In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing Software Requirement Specification. This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle. 

Stage 3: Designing Architecture
Software Requirement Specification is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification which is then assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.

Stage4: Developing Product
At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations. 

Stage 5: Product Testing and Integration
After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS. 

Documentation, Training, and Support

Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products
After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers with product supervision.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall relies on thorough front planning like when a Human Resource Manager has salary budget for the financial year and other igid requirement for a cerain period of time whereas the Agile model is more flexible as it takes these processes in repeating cycles i.e when safariconm has to offer discounts and introduce other offers in order to suit customer needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

                    Assisting in project planning, estimation, risk analysis and timeline management


Quality Assurance Engineer: Examines programs to identify bugs and defects, especially when they appear unexpectedly. To evaluate the effectiveness of various product functionalities and aspects, they frequently use a variety of testsHelps the software development team to recognize the problems early by performing rigorous testing, to guarantee a high-quality product to the end user.
                  Roles: Test planning – Which involves activities of defining the objectives of testing and the approach for meeting test objectives.

• Test Strategy – Create a test strategy based on project requirements and schedules.

• Early testing to eliminate defects at an early stage reduces the bug fixing cost and time.

• Executing tests with appropriate techniques (manually or by using test execution tools) and documenting testing failures.

• Analyze the Defects and identify the root cause.

• Troubleshoot defects, such that it does not affect the product quality.

• Report defects to software developers by recording software defects with a bug-tracking system. (e.g Bugzilla, mantis, QA Touch, etc.)

• Inform the test progress against a schedule of the quality management.

• Interact with BA, project manager, development team, and client as per need.

• Conduct different test procedures, report issues, and follow up on the status of the issues.

• Collaborate with the software testing team to assess or diagnose problems and suggest possible solutions.

• Monitor and analyze the performance using tools for efficient and problem-free operations.

• Uncover vulnerabilities in the system and determine that its data and resources are protected from intruders.

• Provides a test summary report that reflects the software under the test’s top-notch quality.

• Manage the entire testing activity with different test management tools. (eg. QA Touch)

Project Manager:  planning the project, leading the team, executing the project according to the plan, managing the schedule, overseeing the budget, monitoring progress, identifying and mitigating risks, ensuring timely delivery of deliverables, and maintaining clear communication with all stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier eg Pycharm while A version control system (VCS) is a tool that tracks changes to the codebase in a software product and is designed to manage multiple file versions. It makes it easier for software teams to collaborate, maintain clean code and fix mistakes. One of the most common examples of a VCS is GitHub


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping Up with Rapidly Evolving Technologies- Enroll in specialized courses to deepen understanding of new tools and frameworks
Managing Technical Debt - Balance quick fixes with long term maintainability goals.
Burnout and Stress - Implement time management techniques such as Pomodoro or time-blocking.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests are very low level and close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. Unit tests are generally quite cheap to automate and can run very quickly by a continuous integration server.

Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. For example, it can be testing the interaction with the database or making sure that microservices work together as expected. These types of tests are more expensive to run as they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running.

System testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution. It tests if the system meets the specified requirements and if it is suitable for delivery to the end-users. This type of testing is performed after the integration testing and before the acceptance testing.

Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. But they can also go further and measure the performance of the system and reject changes if certain goals are not met.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs. Even though generative AI attempts to mimic humans, it requires detailed instructions to create high-quality and relevant output. 

Importance
Makes AI applications more efficient and effective
Makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increases flexibility


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: What did the President say?
Clear Pormpt: What did the President of Kenya say about the Finance Bill?

 Improved prompt helps the AI to focus only on the request and provide a response that aligns with the objective.
